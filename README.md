## Databases

Category Three is concerned with Databases. The artifact I will be using for this category will be from DAD 220: Introduction to SQL. In this course, I learned how to create structured database environments that integrated basic processing functions and enable data management, manipulation, and analysis in Codio.

### Load and Query the Data
Import the data from each file into tables. Using the QuantigrationRMA database, the three tables I created, and the three CSV files loaded into Codio.

Using the import utility of the database program to load the data from each file into the table of the same name. I performed this step three times, once for each table.

### Write Queries to Organize and Analyze the Data
Write an SQL query that returns the count of orders for customers located only in the city of Framingham, Massachusetts.

### Insert New Data
Write an SQL query to insert four new records into the orders and customers tables.

### Delete Data
Write an SQL statement to delete all records with a reason of “Rejected.”

### Create an Output File
Write an SQL statement to list the contents of the orders table and send the output to a file that has a .csv extension.
